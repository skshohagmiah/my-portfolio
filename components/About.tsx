          Hi, I&apos;m Shohag Miah, a regular guy from Gazipur, Bangladesh, with
          a not-so-regular journey into the tech world. Picture this: at 14, I
          started working in a beverage company, tackling grown-up
          responsibilities. But my heart was set on something elseâ€”computers.

          Fast forward to 2018, I scraped together cash to buy my first laptop.
          It was a game-changer. After my regular job, I spent late nights
          diving into digital marketing, learning English, and exploring the
          tech universe.

          Come 2021, I took the plunge into programming and web development. No
          fancy degrees, just me, Google, and determination. I picked up HTML,
          CSS, and later, fancy stuff like Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, React.js,
          Next.js, and Prisma.

          Two years in, and React and Next.js are my go-to buddies for creating
          websites. No classrooms, just a guy with a laptop, turning challenges
          into triumphs, one line of code at a time

          Coding, to me, is like painting. I use hard work and learning as my
          brushes, and technology is my canvas. I don&apos;`t just make
          websites; I create digital experiences that make people smile.
